# pi-v

Pi extensions and skills for [Vers](https://vers.sh) VM management and development workflows.

## Install

One-liner that checks for pi, installs it if needed, and sets everything up:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hdresearch/pi-v/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or if you already have pi:

```bash
pi install git@github.com:hdresearch/pi-v.git
```
